# Activity Campaign site

You can see this site live at [https://activate.mozilla.community/](https://activate.mozilla.community/)

## How to add or update content

All content can be edited using just [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files.

* Front page (in English) can be modified editing [index.md](/_includes/index.md).
* Pages can be added/edited from the [_pages](/_pages) folder, including subfolders for localized content (front page included).
* User interface strings for all languages are in [_data/l10n](/_data/l10n/).

Each page has a top section with some variables:

```
---
layout: page
title:  "Developer Engagement"
permalink: /developer-engagement/
lang: en
ref: developer-engagement
---
``` 

* **layout:** Layout for the page. This has to be ``page``.
* **title:** (Localizable) Main title for the page.
* **permalink:** (Unique, Localizable) URL for the page, can include lang code for localized pages.
* **lang:** (Localizable) Language code for this page, usually ``en``.
* **ref:** Reference for this page. Just use the permalink in English, all localized pages should have the same one.
* **parent** (Optional) For subpages this defines the parent page ref.
